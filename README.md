# raytracer
A very basic raytracer implementation.
Based on https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing/how-does-it-work

My only addition is adding threading to the main rendering loop. By adding a single pragma we can improve performance 10-fold. May this serve as a practical motivator for learning about parallelism generally.

Perhaps one day I may re-write this for full GPU support.
